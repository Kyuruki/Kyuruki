Currently I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago concentrating in Software Engineering. I’ve been building computers and experimenting with technology since I was young, and that curiosity evolved into designing full systems, not just writing code, but deploying, securing, and maintaining infrastructure. In 2023, I earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, which strengthened my understanding of cloud fundamentals and modern distributed systems.

Right now, I focus on building full-stack applications and backend systems with an emphasis on clean architecture, scalability, and maintainability. I’m especially interested in how software is structured, learning about specific APIs, organizing codebases, and implementing patterns that make systems easier to extend and test. 

Alongside application development, I deploy and manage my own environments, which has strengthened my understanding of how software behaves in real-world conditions. Running and maintaining services has taught me to write more reliable code, design with failure in mind, and consider how infrastructure, networking, and backend logic interact. For me, strong software engineering means understanding both the code and the system it runs on.

My long-term goal is to work in software engineering roles that intersect backend development, cloud infrastructure, and systems design. I’m especially interested in scalable backend systems, DevOps workflows, distributed systems, and infrastructure automation. I aim to contribute to teams where I can help design resilient systems, improve performance, and ship software that has real-world impact.
